# car-accidents-yucatan

In this project, an analysis was performed to visualize how car accidents in municipalities in the state of Yucatan have been increasing or decreasing, for this, a preprocessing of the data used from the INEGI page was carried out, as the data originally published. They do not include geographic coordinates. They could be obtained from the name of the municipality. As a result, changes can be seen in 1997. To obtain the maps for the years 1997 and 2017, only use the Map_Visualization_Car_Accidents.ipynb notebook.
